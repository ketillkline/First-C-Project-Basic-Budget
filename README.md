# First-C++-Project-Basic-Budget
This is about as simple as you could get. Join me as I starting learning C++ !

## Why?
As I begin my pathway down data structures and algorithms, I hit a particular structure that I'd like to code: a dynamic array. Sure, Python already has dynamic arrays widely available in the
form of lists, but I want to fully understand the underworkings of this structure. Thus, I have made it my goal to code and architect one from scratch in C++
Gives me an excuse to learn it, too. I want a high-level language and low-level language under my belt.
However, as you can see, this is no dyanmic array. Indeed, I have no idea how to code in C++, so I have to start basic.

## What is included
- A display_money method to see how much money you have
- An add_money method to add money in
- A use-money method to take away money

## Potential Future Additions
- A safeguard against the amount ever hitting zero. For example, if you have $20 but try and use $30, it will stop you
- A way to specify what you used your money on
- Tracking of all transactions and a way to display them
